This repository contains **unofficial** builds of the Nim compiler for various Linux distributions and CPU architectures.

The builds are tested against a very small subset of the Nim test suite.

The GNU builds are tested against Debian Buster, Ubuntu Bionic, Ubuntu Focal, Arch Linux, and Manjaro Linux.

The musl builds are tested on Alpine Linux 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.

Pull requests targetting other architectures are welcome!
